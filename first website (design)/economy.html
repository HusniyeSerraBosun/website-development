                <h3>Rising egg prices in the US spark chicken rental trend</h3>

                    With egg prices soaring in the US, Christine and Brian Templeton of Rent The Chicken in Goffstown, New Hampshire, offer a unique solution—chicken rentals.
                    Their service provides hens, feed, and support for six months, allowing customers to collect fresh eggs at home. For about $600 (£476.88), two hens can produce a dozen eggs per week.
                    Many renters grow attached to their chickens and choose to keep them. As egg shortages continue, the Templetons' business is gaining popularity as a sustainable and affordable alternative.

                <h3>Domino’s Pizza loses millions of customers to rivals. Here’s how it’s fixing that</h3>

                    Adding a stuffed crust to a pizza chain’s menu doesn’t seem like a big deal. But for Domino’s Pizza, it’s more than three decades in the making.
                    The option was introduced in 1995 by Pizza Hut — launching with a TV ad starring Donald Trump — and became an immediate hit for the pizza chain. 
                    However, by Domino’s own admission, the company’s former leadership believed that stuffed crust was just going to be a fad and would create operational problems, such as slowing down the kitchen’s speed.
                    “That never really felt on brand for us,” said Kate Trumbull, Domino’s chief marketing officer. 
                    “We know the importance of really keeping operations as smooth and as efficient as possible. It just it wasn’t right at that time for us.”
                    That’s changing Monday. Domino’s is adding a parmesan cheese stuffed crust to US menus, marking the first time it’s ever sold the item that has become a staple on its rivals’ boards. 
                    The new crust is being sold for $9.99 with one topping.

                <h3>US tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China take effect, opening door to painful trade war</h3>

                    President Donald Trump’s blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, an extraordinary action aimed at bringing America’s top trading partners to heel.
                    But it threatens to weaken the North American economy, including that of the United States, at a time of significant stress.
                    Trump also doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. Those duties sit atop existing tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese goods.
                    “While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the situation,” according to a statement released by the White House shortly before the tariffs took effect.
                    The tariffs come at a time when inflation remains stubbornly high. Americans, and the US economy as a whole, are on shakier ground, as evidenced by recent data.
                    The tariffs threaten to raise the prices Americans pay for a wide array of goods that are imported from the three nations, which collectively shipped $1.4 trillion worth of goods to the US last year, according to Commerce Department data.
                    That accounts for more than 40% of the value of all goods the US imported last year.
                    The only goods that won’t face a 25% tariff from Canada are energy-related items such as crude oil, one of the top goods the US imports from there.
                    Instead, they’ll be subject to a 10% tax.
                    Fresh produce, cars and car parts and electronics, including phones and computers, are among the top goods the US imports from Mexico, Canada and China that will now face tariffs between 20% and 25%.
